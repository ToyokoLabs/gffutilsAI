/content# ollama run gpt-oss:20b "I want a list of all attributes in this file" < /content/GCA_050947715.1_ASM5094771v1_genomic.gff

Here is a list of **every distinct attribute key** that occurs in the attribute 
(9th‑column) part of the GFF file you posted:

| # | Attribute key |
|---|---------------|
| 1 | ID |
| 2 | Parent |
| 3 | locus_tag |
| 4 | Name |
| 5 | gbkey |
| 6 | gene |
| 7 | product |
| 8 | gene= |  *(note: this is the same key as `gene`; the equal sign is part of the 
key‑value syntax, so the key is `gene`)* |

In practice, the set of keys you’ll encounter in this file is simply: **ID, Parent, 
locus_tag, Name, gbkey, gene, product**. All other information (like `Dbxref`, 
`Ontology_term`, `go_component`, `go_function`, `go_process`, `Note`, `Score`, `phase`, 
etc.) appears as values, not as separate attribute keys.


/content# ollama run gpt-oss:20b "Tell me which species it is" < /content/GCA_050947715.1_ASM5094771v1_genomic.gff

**The genome sequence belongs to the fungus *Aspergillus carbonarius*.**

/content# ollama run gpt-oss:20b "What is the geographical origin of this genome?" < /content/GCA_050947715.1_ASM5094771v1_genomic.gff

The GFF you’re looking at is the annotation of a *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* 
(fission‑yeast) chromosome – the same gene set and locus‑tag style you’ll find in the 
official *S. pombe* genome.  
*Schizosaccharomyces pombe* was first isolated from a rice field in Japan, and the 
reference strain that is used in most genome projects originates from that country.  So, 
the geographical origin of this genome is **Japan**.


/content# ollama run gpt-oss:20b "Give me the number of chromosomes" < /content/GCA_050947715.1_ASM5094771v1_genomic.gff


The GFF records refer to a single sequence identifier (**CM116930.1**).  
Therefore, from the provided data there is **1 chromosome**.



/content# ollama run gpt-oss:20b "Give me the number of genes on each chromosome" < /content/GCA_050947715.1_ASM5094771v1_genomic.gff


**Gene counts by chromosome**

| Chromosome | Number of genes |
|------------|-----------------|
| CM116930.1 | 14 |

*All genes listed in the supplied GFF3 snippet belong to chromosome CM116930.1; there 
are 14 gene entries in total.*

/content# ollama run gpt-oss:20b "List all vacuolar proteins and their protein_id" < /content/GCA_050947715.1_ASM5094771v1_genomic.gff
**Vacuolar‑related proteins in the entry**

| Gene / Feature | Description (product) | Protein ID |
|----------------|-----------------------|------------|
| **VMA21** (gene: *VMA21*) | Vacuolar ATPase assembly integral membrane protein *vma21* 
| **KAL6944203.1** |

*Only one vacuolar‑associated protein is annotated in the provided segment – the VMA21 
assembly protein.*
