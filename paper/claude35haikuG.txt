Query 1/6: I want a list of all attributes in GCA_050947715.1_ASM5094771v1_genomic.gff
============================================================
I'll help you retrieve the list of all attributes from the specified GFF file. I'll use the `get_all_attributes` function to accomplish this.
Tool #1: get_all_attributes
Here's a breakdown of the attributes found in the GFF file:

1. gene_biotype
2. chromosome
3. genome
4. Dbxref
5. collection-date
6. go_component
7. Name
8. country
9. strain
10. ID
11. orig_protein_id
12. start_range
13. gbkey
14. end_range
15. go_function
16. mol_type
17. Note
18. orig_transcript_id
19. partial
20. Ontology_term
21. protein_id
22. isolation-source
23. go_process
24. product
25. gene
26. locus_tag
27. Parent

These attributes provide various types of information about the genomic features in the file, including:
- Identifiers (ID, Name, locus_tag)
- Biological classifications (gene_biotype, mol_type)
- Ontology and functional annotations (go_component, go_function, go_process)
- Metadata (collection-date, country, strain, isolation-source)
- Sequence-related information (protein_id, orig_protein_id, orig_transcript_id)
- Structural information (Parent, start_range, end_range, partial)
- Additional notes and cross-references (Note, Dbxref, Ontology_term)

Is there anything specific you'd like to know about these attributes or would you like me to help you explore them further?
============================================================
Query 2/6: Tell me which species it is
============================================================
I'll help you identify the species by using the `get_organism_info` function with the accession number from the GFF file.
Tool #2: get_organism_info
The GFF file is for the species Hanseniaspora uvarum, which is a type of budding yeast. 

Some additional details:
- Scientific Name: Hanseniaspora uvarum
- Taxonomy ID: 29833
- Classification Group: Budding yeasts & allies

Hanseniaspora uvarum is a non-Saccharomyces yeast species that is often found in various environments, including fruits, wine fermentation, and other ecological niches. It's of interest in microbiology and fermentation studies due to its unique characteristics and potential industrial applications.

Would you like to know more about this organism or explore the genomic features in the GFF file?
============================================================
Query 3/6: What is the geographical origin of this genome?
============================================================
I'll check the attributes we previously found to see if there's information about the geographical origin. From the attributes list, I can see there are two potentially relevant attributes: 'country' and 'isolation-source'. I'll use the `search_features_by_attribute` function to retrieve this information.
Tool #3: search_features_by_attribute
I can provide you with detailed information about the geographical origin:

- Country of Origin: Australia
- Strain: AWRI5759_A6
- Collection Date: 2014
- Isolation Source: FOODON_00001071 (which seems to be a food-related ontology term)

The genome was collected in Australia in 2014, likely from a food-related source. The strain AWRI5759_A6 suggests it was collected by the Australian Wine Research Institute (AWRI), which is known for studying yeasts involved in wine fermentation.

Interestingly, the isolation source code FOODON_00001071 might represent a specific type of food or food-related environment, though without additional context, I can't specify exactly what that is.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these details?
============================================================
Query 4/6: Give me the number of chromosomes
============================================================
I'll use the `get_chromosomes_info` function to retrieve the list of chromosomes:
Tool #4: get_chromosomes_info
The genome has 7 chromosomes. Their specific identifiers are:
1. CM116924.1
2. CM116925.1
3. CM116926.1
4. CM116927.1
5. CM116928.1
6. CM116929.1
7. CM116930.1

Let me also provide some additional context about these chromosomes from the previous query:

Chromosome | Length
-----------|-------
CM116924.1 | 616,678 bp
CM116925.1 | 971,298 bp
CM116926.1 | 1,013,274 bp
CM116927.1 | 1,293,909 bp
CM116928.1 | 1,486,871 bp
CM116929.1 | 1,575,313 bp
CM116930.1 | 1,922,076 bp

The chromosomes vary in size, with the smallest being 616,678 base pairs and the largest being 1,922,076 base pairs. This is typical for yeast genomes, which often have multiple chromosomes of varying sizes.

Would you like me to provide any further analysis of these chromosomes?
============================================================
Query 5/6: Give me the number of genes on each chromosome
============================================================
I'll use the `get_chromosome_summary` function to get the number of genes on each chromosome:
Tool #5: get_chromosome_summary
Here's the breakdown of genes on each chromosome:

Chromosome | Chromosome Length | Number of Genes | Average Gene Length
-----------|------------------|----------------|-------------------
CM116924.1 | 616,678 bp       | 294            | 1,495.5 bp
CM116925.1 | 971,298 bp       | 434            | 1,631.19 bp
CM116926.1 | 1,013,274 bp     | 478            | 1,525.26 bp
CM116927.1 | 1,293,909 bp     | 594            | 1,577.15 bp
CM116928.1 | 1,486,871 bp     | 699            | 1,526.0 bp
CM116929.1 | 1,575,313 bp     | 710            | 1,562.77 bp
CM116930.1 | 1,922,076 bp     | 905            | 1,505.63 bp

Total number of genes: 4,114

Some interesting observations:
- The number of genes increases with chromosome size
- The largest chromosome (CM116930.1) has the most genes (905)
- The smallest chromosome (CM116924.1) has the fewest genes (294)
- The average gene length is relatively consistent across chromosomes, ranging from about 1,495 to 1,631 base pairs

Would you like me to provide any further analysis of the gene distribution?
============================================================
Query 6/6: List all vacuolar proteins and their protein_id
============================================================
I'll help you find the vacuolar proteins. I'll use a combination of approaches to find these proteins:

1. First, I'll search for genes with GO terms related to vacuolar function
2. Then, I'll retrieve their protein IDs
Tool #6: search_genes_by_go_function_attribute
I'll try a broader search:
Tool #7: search_genes_by_go_function_attribute
I'll try a different approach by searching for features with "vacuolar" in their attributes:
Tool #8: search_features_by_attribute
Based on the search results, here are the vacuolar proteins and their protein IDs:

1. Vacuolar Protein Sorting-Associated Protein 4 (VPS4)
   - Protein ID: KAL6951512.1
   - Chromosome: CM116924.1
   - Gene Locus: ACO0OE_000020

2. Vacuolar ATP Synthase Subunit B (VMA2)
   - Protein ID: KAL6951487.1
   - Chromosome: CM116925.1
   - Gene Locus: ACO0OE_000723

3. Vacuolar Protein Sorting-Associated Protein 1 (VPS1)
   - Protein ID: KAL6949444.1
   - Chromosome: CM116927.1
   - Gene Locus: ACO0OE_001531

4. Vacuolar Transporter Chaperone (VTC1)
   - Protein ID: Not directly specified in the results
   - Chromosome: CM116928.1
   - Gene Locus: ACO0OE_002138

Note: There might be more vacuolar proteins in the genome, but these are the ones that were found in this initial search. The search was based on the "product" attribute containing the word "vacuolar".

Would you like me to perform a more comprehensive search or provide more details about these proteins?
