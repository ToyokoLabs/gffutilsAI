Query 2/6: Tell me which species it is
============================================================

Tool #2: get_organism_info
The GFF file belongs to **Hanseniaspora uvarum**, which is a species of budding yeasts and allies. The taxonomy ID for this organism is 29833.

Hanseniaspora uvarum is commonly known as a yeast species often found in wine fermentation and various fruit environments.
============================================================
Query 3/6: What is the geographical origin of this genome?
============================================================

Tool #3: get_features_with_attribute

Tool #4: get_features_with_attribute

Tool #5: get_features_with_attribute

Tool #6: get_features_with_attribute
Based on the metadata in the GFF file, the geographical origin of this Hanseniaspora uvarum genome is:

**Australia**

Additional details from the metadata:
- **Strain**: AWRI5759_A6
- **Collection date**: 2014
- **Isolation source**: FOODON_00001071 (which appears to be a food-related source, likely related to wine or food fermentation given the typical habitat of Hanseniaspora uvarum)

This strain was isolated from a food source in Australia in 2014, which is consistent with Hanseniaspora uvarum being commonly found in wine fermentation environments and various fruit-related food sources.
============================================================
Query 4/6: Give me the number of chromosomes
============================================================

Tool #7: get_chromosomes_info
This Hanseniaspora uvarum genome has **7 chromosomes**.

The chromosome identifiers are:
- CM116924.1
- CM116925.1  
- CM116926.1
- CM116927.1
- CM116928.1
- CM116929.1
- CM116930.1
============================================================
Query 5/6: Give me the number of genes on each chromosome
============================================================

Tool #8: get_chromosome_summary
Here's the number of genes on each chromosome in the Hanseniaspora uvarum genome:

**Gene count per chromosome:**
- **CM116924.1**: 294 genes
- **CM116925.1**: 434 genes  
- **CM116926.1**: 478 genes
- **CM116927.1**: 594 genes
- **CM116928.1**: 699 genes
- **CM116929.1**: 710 genes
- **CM116930.1**: 905 genes

**Total genes in the genome: 4,114 genes**

The largest chromosome (CM116930.1) contains the most genes (905), while the smallest chromosome (CM116924.1) has the fewest genes (294). This distribution shows a general correlation between chromosome size and gene count, which is typical for eukaryotic genomes.
