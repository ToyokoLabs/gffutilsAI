🧬 GFF Query: why are you including as vacuolar, hypothetical proteins like hypothetical protein | KAL6951498.1 ?
------------------------------
That's an excellent question, and it points to a very important aspect of bioinformatics and genome annotation.

Here's the breakdown of why a protein can be labeled both "hypothetical" and "vacuolar":

1.  **"Hypothetical Protein"**: This label is used for the `product` attribute when a gene sequence is predicted to code for a protein, but there is no direct experimental evidence to prove what that protein does or what its specific function is. It's essentially a placeholder name indicating "we think this is a protein, but we haven't studied it in a lab yet."

2.  **"Vacuolar" Classification**: This classification comes from a different source of information: **automated computational analysis**. In the GFF file, for the protein `KAL6951498.1`, we can see an attribute called `go_component` (Gene Ontology Component).

For that specific protein, the `go_component` attribute includes several terms that explicitly link it to the vacuole, such as:
*   `vacuolar membrane|0005774||IEA`
*   `lytic vacuole|0000323||IEA`
*   `vacuole|0005773||IEA`

These annotations are based on computational predictions. The programs that generate these annotations look for patterns in the protein's sequence (like specific domains or targeting signals) that are similar to other, well-studied proteins known to be located in the vacuole.

The key part is the **"IEA"** tag at the end of each term. This is an evidence code that stands for **"Inferred from Electronic Annotation."** It means the "vacuolar" location was assigned automatically by a computer program, not by a human curator looking at experimental results.

**In summary:** The protein is called **"hypothetical"** because its function has not been experimentally confirmed, and it is classified as **"vacuolar"** because computational models predict it has features that would send it to the vacuole. Both labels reflect that our knowledge about this protein is based on prediction, not direct laboratory proof.
