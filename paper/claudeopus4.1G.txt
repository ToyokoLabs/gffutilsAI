============================================================
Query 2/6: Tell me which species it is
============================================================
I'll get the organism information for this GFF file using the accession number.
Tool #2: get_organism_info
This GFF file is from **Hanseniaspora uvarum**, which is a species of budding yeast.

**Organism details:**
- **Species**: *Hanseniaspora uvarum*
- **Common classification**: Budding yeasts & allies
- **NCBI Taxonomy ID**: 29833
- **Accession**: GCA_050947715.1

*Hanseniaspora uvarum* is an apiculate (lemon-shaped) yeast commonly found on grapes and in wine fermentation. It's one of the most prevalent non-Saccharomyces yeasts in winemaking and plays an important role in the early stages of spontaneous fermentation, contributing to the aroma and flavor complexity of wines.
============================================================
Query 3/6: What is the geographical origin of this genome?
============================================================
I'll search for the geographical origin information in the GFF file by looking at features that have the "country" attribute.
Tool #3: get_features_with_attribute
Based on the GFF file metadata, this *Hanseniaspora uvarum* genome has the following geographical origin:

**Geographical Origin: Australia**

**Additional collection details:**
- **Collection date**: 2014
- **Strain**: AWRI5759_A6
- **Isolation source**: FOODON_00001071 (this appears to be a food ontology term)

The strain designation "AWRI" likely stands for **Australian Wine Research Institute**, which is consistent with the Australian origin and the fact that *H. uvarum* is an important wine yeast. This strain (AWRI5759_A6) was isolated in Australia in 2014, presumably from a wine-related source given the organism's ecological niche and the involvement of AWRI.
============================================================
Query 4/6: Give me the number of chromosomes
